# Install scripts - test 

## About

This repository contains a short Bash script for installing various packages for my development work. The script presents a list of packages I can choose from. I still need to figure out how to update this to actually install the packages I need.

## Installation

Run the script with Bash:

```bash
  bash install_script.sh
```
